  <div class="Tahajjud">  <h2>Benefits Of Tahajud</h2> </div>
    <p>Tahajjud prayer is a nafl or voluntary prayer.
         It is a night prayer that is offered to attain mental strength and peace. It is also known to avert acts of sin. Prayer (Salat) — one of the Five Pillars of Islam, is segregated into four main types: <br>
<ul>
        Fardh Salat: The most important prayer in Islam; it is compulsory, and missing it is considered to be a major sin.
        Wajib Salat: It is compulsory, and missing Wajib Salat is regarded as a grave sin too.
<br>
        Sunnah Salat: Known to be Prophet Muhammad’s (PBUH) practice, Sunnah Salat is again segregated into two categories, namely Muakkadah and Ghair Muakkadah. The former is to be practiced regularly, and missing the same is regarded as a sin. However, missing the latter one, which is said to be practiced intermittently by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), is not considered punishable.
<br>
        Nafl: The last of the four main types of prayer, Nafl is not compulsory and is usually performed for an extra virtue. Missing this prayer is not considered to be a sin. <br>
       </ul>
<br>
The Tahajjud prayer is associated with several benefits and rewards. As Tahajjud salah involves waking up in the middle of slumber, it is said to offer great rewards from the Almighty. Here are some of its benefits along with Hadiths regarding the same.
<br>
1. Tahajjud prayer is one of the best ways to attain closeness to Allah.
<br>
“Be vigilant in standing up [in prayer] at night, for it was the practice of the pious before you. It is a means of gaining proximity to Allah Ta’ala, expiation for transgressions and a barrier from sins.” (Tirmidhi)
<br>
2. The Holy Quran also mentions that those devoting time to praying Tahajjud reap great benefits.
<br>
“And the servants of the Most Merciful [Allah] are those who walk upon the earth easily, and when the ignorant address them [harshly], they say [words of] peace, and devote [part of] the night to their Lord prostrating and standing [in prayer].” (Quran 25:63-64)
<br>
3. Tahajjud prayer is that it gives inner strength and mental peace. It also has the capability to avert acts of sin and wickedness. Also, according to the Islamic tradition, the third part of the night is the best time to make wishes/duas.
<br>
Prophet (PBUH) said: “During the night there is a time when the Muslim does not ask for the good of this world and the Hereafter but it will be given to him, and that happens every night.”
<br>
4. Also known to be the best among the voluntary prayers, one major benefit of performing Tahajjud is that it helps with everyday problems. While performing this prayer, one completely places their trust in Allah and leaves all worldly worries. When a believer leaves everything to the Almighty, the supreme power then assists different sources.
<br>
“And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.” (Surah Talaq Ch 65, V3)
<br>
5. It is also said that the Tahajjud prayer grants patience even in the face of problems. Incorporating Tahajjud into the daily routine is known to bring peace to the distressed heart.
<br>
Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: “The closest that the Lord is to His slave is in the latter part of the night, so if you can be one of those who remember Allah at that time, then do so.” (Al-Tirmidhi and al-Nisaa’i)
